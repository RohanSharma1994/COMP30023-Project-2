Compilation instructions:
Typing "make" should build the project.

If there is any problems running the project:
You can use the following command (just copy + paste in terminal (must be in project2 directory)):
gcc -o client client.c connection.c
gcc -o server server.c connection.c -pthread
For some reason if the compiler fails to link the libraries automatically, you can use these commands:
gcc -o client client.c connection.c -lsocket -lnsl
gcc -o server server.c connection.c -pthread -lsocket -lnsl

All the documentation for the functions are in their respective files, and the file structure is described below:

Makefile: The makefile for this project.
client.c: Contains all the code for the client.
client.h: Header file for client.c.
connect4.c: This is what we were provided. Only thing I did was removed the main() function.
connection.c: This contains code for socket initialization for both the server and client.
connection.h: Header file for connection.h.
log.txt: Used to describe the interactions between server and client.
project2b.txt: Project 2b.
server.c: Contains all the code for the server.
server.h: Header file for server.c.
